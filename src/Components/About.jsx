            Theatrium is the main venue on the cruise ship AIDAnova, serving as
            a huge living room and place to hang out during daytime and an
            entertainment venue in the night. It was my first time being
            responsible as system lead video for engineering the numerous LED
            screens in the venue.

          <p>
            Besides selecting the best matching product on the market regarding
            available sizes, possible customizations, reliability, quality and
            price the main challenges were integrating all the surfaces into the
            ship's design, planning a proper cable infrastructure for fixed as
            well as moving parts and dimension the necessary amount of playout
            servers to maximize the performance.

            {" "}
            The whole project took from 2016 to 2018, ending with a four months
            installation and commissioning span on site to finally hand over the
            system to the customer.{" "}

            The Dinner Entertainment Restaurant was another huge project we
            relized from 2016 to 2018 on AIDAnova. Guests enjoy dinner and an
            interactive show in the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            More than 100 UHD displays had to be integrated and served with
            synchronous video content to create the illusion of sitting in an
            underwater boat, travelling through the sea to a secret place. All
            that supported by visual and sound effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Installation of displays overhead were one of the main challenges to
            overcome. In general the limitted space, low ceiling height and
            large amount of technology to be installed forced us to adapt
            engineering many times.

            Another cruise ship series we equipped with entertainment technology
            started with Costa Smeralda in 2017. Responsible for about 30
            venues, the Colosseo was surely the most challenging one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similar to AIDAnova the customer asked for a lot of LED screens to
            be integrated. The main challenge was a LED dome spanning the whole
            venue, sonsisting of more than 2000 single LED tiles out of three
            different product types, such combined together to create the
            illusion of looking into the sky, watching the clouds passing by.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the single tiles had to be installed one by one in more than 10
            meters height, organizing everything down to the smallest in advance
            was indispensable. As well as simultaneous commisioning and testing
            during installation.

          <p>
            On all five ships of Royal Caribbean Quantum class we installed the
            so called Vistarama projection in the venue Two70. Sun shades can
            brought down and be projected on with 18 4K laser projectors,
            forming one large screen along the whole width of the ship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surely one of the most impressing installations I've seen so far. I
            was not responsible for the engineering but for the commissioning of
            the system on three of five ships.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also very impressing are the six robot LED screens moving in front
            of the Vistarama and forming either individual screens or one large
            one. We supplied them with the LED tiles and were also responsible
            for video playout always matching the position and orientation of
            the screens. Robots and their movement was done by ABB who we spent
            a lot of time with to synchronize movement and images.
